                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Nikita Fastovets</strong> — a passionate full-stack developer and Computer Science
                    student at
                    KNEU. I enjoy building modern web applications using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and WordPress,
                    and I love creating clean, functional interfaces that actually make sense.
                    I’m currently developing Qurvey, a survey and analytics platform, where I handle both backend
                    and frontend logic. My goal is to keep learning, improving, and turning ideas into real working
                    products.
                    Outside of coding, I train in Taekwon-Do ITF, explore new business concepts, and experiment with
                    tech gear. This blog is where I share my experiences, thoughts, and lessons learned along the way.

                <h4>Taekwon-Do ITF</h4>
                <p> Taekwon-Do ITF has been a big part of my life for years. It’s not just a sport — it’s a way of
                    thinking, a discipline that shapes both the body and the mind. Through training, I’ve learned
                    patience, focus, and respect — not only for others but also for myself.

                    I’ve competed in numerous tournaments, constantly pushing my limits and learning from every fight.
                    Each training session teaches me something new about perseverance and self-control.

                    Taekwon-Do is more than breaking boards or winning medals. It’s about inner strength, confidence,
                    and the drive to improve every single day. That same mindset helps me in coding, studying, and life
                    — to stay sharp, calm, and always ready for the next challenge.

                <h4>Full-Stack Developer | Computer Science Student</h4>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Nikita Fastovets, a full-stack developer and Computer Science student at KNEU. My goal is to
                    build clean, functional, and intuitive web applications that solve real-world problems.
                    I have experience with a modern tech stack, including FastAPI for building high-performance APIs and
                    PostgreSQL for reliable data storage. I am also proficient with WordPress, developing custom
                    solutions.
                    Currently, I am actively developing Qurvey, my own survey and analytics platform, where I handle the
                    full development cycle—from backend logic to the frontend interface. This project allows me to
                    sharpen
                    my technical skills while deepening my understanding of business needs.
                    I am always open to new ideas, challenges, and collaboration opportunities.

            <div class="books">
                <h4>Reading books</h4>
                <p>
                    For me, reading isn't just a pastime; it's a way to understand the systems that shape our world. I'm
                    drawn to non-fiction, especially books on strategy, psychology, and financial literacy. Authors like
                    Robert Kiyosaki ("Rich Dad Poor Dad") and Robert Greene ("The 48 Laws of Power") have trained me to
                    look at challenges from a different, more strategic angle.
                    I believe the principles in these books are universal. Understanding human motivation and long-term
                    planning is just as critical in software development as it is in life. Building a great IT product
                    requires thinking several steps ahead and truly understanding the end-user—skills I sharpen with
                    every book I read. I see it as mental training that complements my physical discipline, helping me
                    achieve my goals both in code and beyond.
